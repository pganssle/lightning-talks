## GridStrategy: A Proposed Mechanism for Automatic Subplot Management

This is a quick 5-minute lightning talk on my proposal for [Matplotlib Enhancement Plan 30](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/MEP30%3A-Grid-population-strategies), which would be a somewhat automagical subplot manager. The same general idea is more broadly applicable to other subplot management.

The slides can be built with `./build.py make`, or if you want to serve it locally, `.build.py --serve`.
